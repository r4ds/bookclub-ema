**Learning objectives:**

- Intuition and Examples
- Calculation Procedure
- Pros and Cons
- R Code


## Intuition and Simplified Example  
  
#### Overview {-}  
* Interaction here is defined as the deviation from additivity.  
* Effects of a given feature depend on other features
* In this chapter, we focus on pairwise interactions, but can extend to higher order interactions  
  
#### Simplified Data Example {-}  

For illustrative purposes, create 2-way table using Titanic Dataset:  
  
* Limit to male subpopulation 
* Bifurcate *Age* variable into "Boys (0-16)" and "Adults (>16)" categories  
* Simplify *Class* into "2nd" class and "other" levels   
  

*Table 7.1: Proportion of Male Survivors on Titanic*  

|Class  |     Boys (0-16)|       Adults (>16)|            Total|
|:------|---------------:|------------------:|----------------:| 
|2nd    |   11/12 = 91.7%|      13/166 = 7.8%|   24/178 = 13.5%|
|other  |   22/69 = 31.9%|   306/1469 = 20.8%| 328/1538 = 21.3%|
|Total  |   33/81 = 40.7%|   319/1635 = 19.5%| 352/1716 = 20.5%|     
  
  
#### Explain Survival Probability for Boys in 2nd Class {-}  
  
**Additive Explanation 1**  
  
* Marginal survival probability for 2nd class is 13.5%, so additive effect of class for this instance is -7% (13.5% - 20.5%) from mean.    
* Survival probability for boys in 2nd class is 91.7%, so additive effect of boys is 78.2% (91.7% - 13.5%)  
  
**Additive Explanation 2**  
  
* Probability of survival for boys is 40.7%, so additive effect of boys from the mean is 20.2% (40.7% - 20.5%)  
* 2nd class survival chance for boys is 91.7%. Therefore, the 2nd class additive effect is 51% (91.7% - 40.7%)   
  
**Interaction Explanation**  
  
* Additive explanations give different effects depending on order due to interaction
* In other words, class depends on age and vice versa
* Calculate Interaction effect  
  + Calculate contribution of 2nd class/Boys together: (91.7% - 20.5% = 71.2%) 
  + Subtract individual variable contributions to calculate net interaction effect: (71.2% - (-7%) - 20.2%), or 58%,  
* If there were no interaction effects, the probability of survival could be calculated the mean be the mean survival rate + individual variable effects (i.e., 20.5% -7% + 20.2% = 33.7%). However, this is incorrect here due to the presence of the class/age interaction.   


## Method to Calculate Net Interaction Effects  
  
Three step process:  

1. Compute additive contribution of each variable (i.e., deviation from global mean)  
2. Calculate net effect of interaction for each pairwise combination:  
    - Determine the contribution for each pair of explanatory variables, PC (paired contribution) 
    - Compute additive contribution for single variable 1, SC1 (single contribution 1)  
    - Calculate additive contribution for single variable 2, SC2 (single contribution 2)  
    - Putting together, net interaction effect = PC - SC1 - SC2  

3. Rank contributions for both individual variables and pairwise interactions using the absolute value of the contribution effects. Use ranking for ordering variable importance calculations. 
  
## Realistic Example Using Titanic Dataset  
  
This section shows manual calculations of variable importance using a random forest model on the Titanic dataset.  
  
The explanations relate to fictitious passenger, Johnny D, described in an earlier chapter.

**Example Calculation for Net Interaction Effect of Age:Fair**  

* *fare* contribution (column 4) = 0.143
* *age* contribution (column 4) = 0.270  
* *fair:age* contribution (column 2) = 0.249
* Net interaction = 0.249 - 0.143 - 0.270 = -0.164  
  
  
**Steps for Calculating Variable Importance Tables and Breakdown Plots**  

1. Rank and sort variables and interaction net effects according to absolute value of contributions--see Table 2.  
2. Each variable should only appear once, either as a single variable or as part of an interaction effect. Keep top contribution only.  
3. Calculate variable importance measure as described in chapter six


*Table 7.3: Variable-Importance Measures*  

|Variable               |  $j$ | $v(j,\underline{x}_*)$ | $v_0+\sum_{k=1}^j v(k,\underline{x}_*)$|
|:----------------------|------:|------------:|-----------:|
|intercept  ($v_0$)     |       |             |   0.235    |
|age = 8                |   1   |    0.269    |   0.505    |
|fare:class = 72:1st    |   2   |    0.039    |   0.544    |
|gender = male          |   3   |   -0.083    |   0.461    |
|embarked = Southampton |   4   |   -0.002    |   0.458    |
|sibsp = 0              |   5   |   -0.006    |   0.452    |
|parch = 0              |   6   |   -0.030    |   0.422    |

## Pros and Cons   

**Pros**  

* Model agnostic approach  
* Can potentially provide more accurate explanations than additive effects only
* Plots can be easy to interpret in many cases  

**Cons**  

* Calculation complexity -  need to calculate contributions for p(p+1)/2 variables and pairwise interactions
* Credibility issues - for small datasets, net contributions are subject to larger randomness in ranking  
* Procedure is not based on formal statistical test of significance and relies on heuristics.
  + false positives  
  + false negatives - more likely with small samples  
* With many variables and interactions, plots can be complex with small contributions to instance prediction

## R Code Examples  
  
Example uses titanic dataset, and new instance of a fictitious passenger, Henry.  
  
We're also using the DALEX package to explain predictions from a pre-loaded random forest model.
  
Load the data.

```{r 07-load-data}
titanic_imputed <- archivist::aread("pbiecek/models/27e5c")
titanic_rf <- archivist:: aread("pbiecek/models/4e0fc")
(henry <- archivist::aread("pbiecek/models/a6538"))

```
 

Build explainer from DALEX library.  
```{r 07-build-explainer, warning=FALSE}

library(DALEX)
library(randomForest)


explain_rf <- DALEX::explain(model = titanic_rf,  
                        data = titanic_imputed[, -9],
                           y = titanic_imputed$survived == "yes", 
                       label = "Random Forest")

```
Calculate contributions of top variables.  

```{r 07-var-contributions} 
bd_rf <- predict_parts(explainer = explain_rf,
                 new_observation = henry,
                            type = "break_down_interactions")
bd_rf

```
  
Output break-down plot.  
```{r 07-ibd-plot}  
plot(bd_rf)

```
  
Compare to break-down plot without interactions.  
  
```{r 07-bd-plot}
bd_rf_noint <- predict_parts(explainer = explain_rf,
                 new_observation = henry,
                            type = "break_down")
plot(bd_rf_noint)
```
