# Introduction to Dataset-level Exploration

**Learning objectives:**

-  Dataset-level (global) explanations
-  Understand how do the model predictions perform overall
-  Model variable importance
-  Understand how does a selected variable influence the modelâ€™s predictions
-  Discover whether there are observations where the model yields wrong predictions

## Part III - Contents

-  Model overall performance measures (`Chapter 15`)
-  Variable importance measures (`Chapter 16`)
-  Partial-dependence  profiles (`Chapter 17`)
-  Local-dependence and accumulated-local profiles (`Chapter 18`)
-  Residuals diagnostics plots (`Chapter 19`)
-  Summary of dataset-level exploration (`Chapter 20`)
