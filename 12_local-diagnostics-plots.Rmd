# Local-diagnostics Plots

**Introduction**

If a model presents a satisfactory **overall predictive performance**, but it's less accurate in some observations. Then we can say that the model **does not cover well** some areas of the **input space**.

Local-diagnostics techniques:

- *Local-fidelity plots* evaluate the local **predictive performance** of the model around the observation of interest.

- *Local-stability plots* assess the (local) **stability of predictions** around the observation of interest.
