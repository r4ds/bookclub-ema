# Ceteris-paribus Oscillations

**Learning objectives:**

- Describe a measure to identify the most interesting or important profiles.


## Basic idea {-}

1. If an explanatory variable has a **large influence** on prediction for a particular instance, then its corresponding CP profile must present **large fluctuations**.

2. If an explanatory variable has **little influence** on prediction for a particular instance, then its corresponding CP profile must present **bare fluctuations** and be close to the **original prediction of the model**.
  - The **sum of differences** between the **profile** and the **prediction** _(across all possible values of the explanatory variable)_ should be close to zero.
  
## Graphical representation {-}
  
The sum of differences can be represented by the **area** between the **profile** and the **line at prediction level**.

## Method {-}

**Remember**, one-dimensional CP profile for all possible values $z$ of the explanatory variable $j$ based the interest observation $\underline{x}_*$.

$$
h^{j}_{\underline{x}_*}(z) \equiv f\left(\underline{x}_*^{j|=z}\right).
$$

$vip_{CP}^j(\underline{x}_*)$ is the **expected absolute deviation** of the **CP profile** $h^{j}_{\underline{x}_*}()$ from the **model's prediction** $f(\underline{x}_*)$, computed over the distribution $g^j(z)$ of the $j$-th explanatory variable.


$$
vip_{CP}^j(\underline{x}_*) = \int_{\mathcal R} |h^{j}_{\underline{x}_*}(z) - f(\underline{x}_*)| g^j(z)dz=E_{X^j}\left\{|h^{j}_{\underline{x}_*}(X^j) - f(\underline{x}_*)|\right\}.
$$

## Method challenge {-}

The **true distribution** of $j$-th explanatory variable is **unknown** and we have 2 alternatives:

1. To assume that $g^j(z)$ is a **uniform distribution** over the range of variable $X^j$ for $k$ selected values _(all unique or equidistant grid)_ of the $j$-th explanatory variable.

$$
\widehat{vip}_{CP}^{j,uni}(\underline{x}_*) = \frac 1k \sum_{l=1}^k |h^{j}_{x_*}(z_l) - f(\underline{x}_*)|
$$

2. To use **all observations** in the dataset $n$ to estimate the **empirical distribution** of $X^{j}$, despite it might require more **computation time**.

$$
\widehat{vip}_{CP}^{j,emp}(\underline{x}_*) = \frac 1n \sum_{i=1}^n |h^{j}_{\underline{x}_*}(x^{j}_i) - f(\underline{x}_*)|
$$

## Local vs global importance {-}

Let's assume a simple model described as the interaction of $X^1$ and $X^1$ in values from 0 to 1 $[0,1]$.

$$
f(x^1, x^2) = x^1 * x^2
$$

- Globally both variables are **equally important**, because the model is symmetrical.

- But if the instance we want to explain $\underline{x}_*$ has $x^1 = 0$ and $x^2 = 1$. Then the importance of $X^1$ is **larger** than $X^2$:
  - $h^1_{x_*}(z) = z$ as $x^2 = 1$ for any value of $z$.
  - $h^2_{x_*}(z) = 0$ as $x^1 = 0$ for any value of $z$.
  
## Example: Henry - random forest model {-}

Both alternatives suggest that the most important variables are **gender** and **age**, followed by **class**.

## Example: Henry - random forest model {-}

The **sibsp** variable gains in relative importance for estimator $\widehat{vip}_{CP}^{j,uni}(\underline{x}_*)$ as it has a very **skewed distribution**.

## Example: Henry - random forest model {-}

It does not describe how do the variables influence the prediction.

- If Henry were older, this would significantly lower his probability of survival.
- Henry not travelling alone, this would increase his chances of survival.
